Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to determine the retiring employees by title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 

RESULTS 

Four Major Points

* Provide a table showing retirement titles of employees who were born in 1952 and 1955. This table is a summary of employees who are predicted to retire soon.

* Retrieve the number of titles of retiring employees to calculate how many employees are retiring. For instance, Senior Engineers, Senior Staff, Engineers, Staff, Technique Leaders, Assistant Engineers, and Managers. 

* Provide data of retiring employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program to mentor non-retiring employees.

Are There Enough Qualified, Retirement-Ready Employees in the Departments to Mentor the Next Generation of Pewlett Hackard Employees?

Unfortunately, there is missing data of the retirement date for retirement-ready employees. Missing data of the retirement date alters analysts providing enough information to present if there are enough retirement-ready employees in the department to mentor. 

If the departments need non-retiring employees to be prepared to take on these future roles. Then, departments can provide a retirement date table to calculate a proper timeline to get all non-retired employees prepared for these future roles in a timely manner.
